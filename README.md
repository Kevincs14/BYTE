### BYTE - Full Stack Meal App
BYTE is a full-stack web application designed to help college students easily manage their meals and nutrition. With a focus on providing fresh, healthy meal options, BYTE offers a weekly selection of four new meals along with easy-to-follow recipes, designed to make meal prep and eating healthy more manageable for students with busy schedules.

As a college student myself, I struggled with meal planning and maintaining a balanced diet, especially while focusing on my fitness journey. I realized that finding simple meal ideas was stressfull and hard to prepare with a busy schedule. That's when I decided to build BYTE to make it easier for students like me to stay on top of their nutrition and health.
